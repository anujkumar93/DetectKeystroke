# DetectKeystroke
Deep Learning project to classify and predict the keystrokes typed by user wearing smartwatches

Wearable consumer electronics with a myriad of sensors
are becoming increasingly popular. With the boost in the
popularity of smartwatches, the expectations from these de-
vices are also on the rise. People desire more features than
only counting steps. This project is aimed at a novel such
use of a smartwatch-like device: to detect keystrokes typed
on a classic QWERTY keyboard. Each key that one types
is associated with a characteristic hand motion and fre-
quency. Using time-series data provided by sensors inside
the smartwatches worn on each hand of a user, we recover
what is being typed on the keyboard. Since the data is af-
fected only by the motion of one’s hands, we show that a
deep network learns to model these hand motions correctly.
We hope to be able to recover the intended words typed by a
user imitating typing on a keyboard in places where a phys-
ical keyboard is not readily available, thus reducing the re-
liance on a physical keyboard in one’s daily life.
